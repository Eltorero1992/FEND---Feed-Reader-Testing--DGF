# Feed Reader Tester

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Motivation

This project covers one of the most important parts on front end development, test suites. On this project I developed 8 different test specs to test the functionality of the web page

## Build Status

Finished: The webpage has been tested and works as intended

## How to Start

Open the index.html file on any web browser (all web browsers supported)

## Bugs

1. The spec which checks for the slide menu to appear on the screen once the 'hamburger' icon is clicked, sometimes throws an error when the tests are run randomly.

## Potential Improvements

1. On the test suite 'New Feeder Selection' more specs can be added to detect change (i.e. change in width of the feed container after feeds have been added)
